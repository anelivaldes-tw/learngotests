/*Declaring a Map is somewhat similar to an array. Except, it starts with the map keyword and requires two types.
The first is the key type, which is written inside the []. The second is the value type,
which goes right after the [].
The key type is special. It can only be a comparable type because without
the ability to tell if 2 keys are equal, we have no way to ensure that we are getting the correct value.*/
